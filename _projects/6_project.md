- Identified key UX issues in standard 'Audio-to-Haptic' systems, primarily perceived latency and a lack of distinct sound source separation.
- Implemented an enhanced processing pipeline that combines low-pass filtering with an AI-powered stem-splitter (spleeter) to isolate and map haptic feedback to specific instruments like bass and drums.
- Conducted two rounds of user tests where participants compared the new system against the conventional method across various music genres, providing qualitative feedback on immersion and synchronization.
- Validated that the AI-enhanced system provided a superior user experience, with test subjects unanimously preferring it for its significant reduction in perceived delay.
